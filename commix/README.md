#### General Information

**Commix** (short for [**comm**]and [**i**]njection e[**x**]ploiter) is an automated tool written by Anastasios Stasinopoulos ([@ancst](https://twitter.com/ancst)) that can be used from web developers, penetration testers or even security researchers in order to test web-based applications with the view to find bugs, errors or vulnerabilities related to **[command injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection)** attacks. By using this tool, it is very easy to find and exploit a command injection vulnerability in a certain vulnerable parameter or HTTP header.
